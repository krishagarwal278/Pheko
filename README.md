Our goal is to create an app that helps and incentivizes customers in India to get rid of their unwanted recyclables, through ragpickers, from the comfort of their home at their convenient time. 

We are solving the problem of waste segregation, trash disposal, space optimization, and formalizing a pre-existing informal industry in India.
