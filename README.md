# Pheko

Our goal is to create an app that helps and incentivizes customers in India to get rid of their unwanted recyclables, through ragpickers, from the comfort of their home at their convenient time.

We are solving the problem of waste segregation, trash disposal, space optimization, and formalizing a pre-existing informal industry in India.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the `customer-app` and `scrapdealer-app` on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/krishagarwal278/Pheko.git
cd Pheko
```

2. **Install Dependencies for Customer App**

Navigate to the `customer-app` directory and install the necessary packages:

```
cd customer-app
npm install
```

3. **Install Dependencies for Scrapdealer App**

Similarly, install dependencies for the `scrapdealer-app`:

Go back to the root directory first

```

## Running the Apps with Expo Go

After installing the dependencies, you can run each app using Expo Go. Follow these steps:

1. **Start Expo for Customer App**

Inside the `customer-app` directory, start the Expo Go environment:

```
cd customer-app
expo start
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the Expo developer tools.

2. **Start Expo for Scrapdealer App**

Similarly, start the Expo Go environment for the `scrapdealer-app`:

Make sure to navigate back to the root directory first

```
cd ..
cd scrapdealer-app
expo start
```

A new tab with Expo developer tools will open in your web browser.

3. **Open the App on Your Device**

To view the app:

- **iOS**: Scan the QR code displayed in the Expo developer tools using your camera. Follow the prompts to open it in the Expo Go app.
- **Android**: Scan the QR code using the Expo Go app.

Repeat these steps whenever you want to run either of the apps. Ensure you have the Expo Go app installed on your mobile device to view the apps in development mode.
